# Nujabes

We see musicians as legendary figures, people that are larger than life because their ability to touch our hearts across thousands of miles or even hundreds of years and nujabes is one of the most legendary 
musicians that's ever lived because he dedicate his life on just one thing creating beautiful music. He was a man who lived and breathed art. His body of work and legacy is a true gift to anyone who comes to 
across it. It touches our hearts no matter who we are or where we come from. His beats were dense and layered and throughout his career he sampled countless genres and create soundscapes that were melancholy 
and hopeful at the same time. Nujabes mixed jazz in hip-pop in a fresh innovative way despite only release two studio albums during his lifetime he became the godfather of lo-fi hip-pop, a pioneer of a genre 
that would only gain popularity years after his tragic death. And at the same time, we don't know much about nujabes himself. He was a quiet person. He kept to himself and shied away from the public eye partly 
du to his career taking place before the age of massively interconnected online internet music communities but his mystery is made even deeper from him being Japanese. He lived on the other side of the planet 
for most his modern-day fans. He barely spoke English and he possibly only give only one interview during his entire career. So who is nujabes, why is his music so powerful and impactful and how did he create 
such universally beloved music while barely showing himself to the world.

Like i said not much is known about nujabes' personal life. He barely give any interviews during his career so most of the information and stories we do have about nujabes come from the different artist he work with in the Japanese under ground scene. Jun Seba, `濑场淳`, his real name that would later be reversed into the world nujabes was born on February 7th, 1974 in inner city Tokyo famously on the same day that Jay Dilla 
another legendary producer was also born. It's said that he went to university for design. He learned photography as a hobby and at one point the wanted to be a writer. But around the time when he graduated from university in the late '90s he opened up a record shop called Guinness Records in Shibuya, a section of Tokyo known for culture and nightlife. At the time Shibuya had the highest concentration of record shops in 
the world thanks to Japan's thriving music scene in the 90s, but like nujabes himself, very little footage of Guinness Record is available on the internet with only one 3-minute clip of the shop uploaded to YouTube. 
A friend and longtime collaborator of nujabes named Pace Rock would later tell this story about the atmosphere of nujabes' record store back in the 90s. He said, Jun's shop was the undergound hip-pop spot and his store leaned more towards stuff you'd sample, Soul, Jazz, lots of stuff like that 60% underground hip-pop 40% others. Nujabes kept the record store running for the rest of his life and before long it became the 
exact place where he begin his journey towards being one of the most legendary hip-pop artists ever. Technicallt nujabes
