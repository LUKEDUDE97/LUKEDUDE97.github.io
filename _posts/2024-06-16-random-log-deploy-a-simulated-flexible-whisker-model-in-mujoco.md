_Simulation Demo on Whisker_

## Structure & Measurement

Build a whisker basement here first in the world body which was enabled to freely move in three directions (3DoF) : 2D translation on X- and Y-axis, 1D rotation around Z-axis.  And secondly, a movable connector between whisker shaft and basement was built, serving a similar function as the magnet and those spring support device in real mechanical design. It was used to reflect the instantaneous rotation on shaft and output the proper measurement. We enabled it to move also in three directions (3DoF) : 2D translation on X- and Y-axis, 1D rotation around Z-axis. 

Both of which were carefully regulate via some important parameters to ensure the stability (deduce the fluctuation during contact on `whikser_base`) and proper movement in certain range (the `whisker_body` was only used to reflect the moment caused by shaft deflection, so the `stiffness` and `damping` were set).

## Flexible Whisker Shaft

> *The cable plugin discretizes an inextensible 1D continuum. It is intended to simulate the twist and bending of rods where the stretching in negligible compared to the other deformation modes.*
> 

We implement `40` parallel `elasticity.cable` elements to fabricate a whole flexible whisker shaft. 

**Parameters:**

- `twist`Â [Pa]: twisting stiffness.
- `bend`Â [Pa]: bending stiffness.
- `flat`Â [bool]: if true, the stress-equilibrium configuration is that of a straight cable; if false or unspecified, it is the configuration defined in the XML.
- `vmax`Â [N/m^2]: If greater than zero, the cable is colored using mechanical stresses; the value represent the maximum stress in the color scale.

## Actuator & Sensor

![Untitled](/localdata/assets/EinsProject/WhiskerBaseFramForCtrl.png){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .right}

The control was mainly built based on an adjustable moving direction $\theta$ within the world-fixed frame of whisker, and two separate fixed linear velocity along X- and Y-axis on whisker base frame. The rotation was built via `whisker_joint_z`, a hinge. So the linear velocity under world-frame of whisker sensor will change with the rotation, according to the figure beside.

We also need an absolute position sensor on the whisker shaftâ€™s tip, therefore to valid our previous tiptap estimate method and collect data to build a post-optimized characteristic model on current shaftâ€™s tip position. BTW, the notation `S_last` would automatically index to the last cable component in the `composite`. Moreover, we have confirmed that the position under this situation was exactly corresponding to the actual tip point which locate at the endpoint of the last cable, not the middle, not the start point, since thereâ€™s still a length of 0.1 of this single element so it matters. 

```xml
  <actuator>
    <!-- velocity control -->
    <velocity joint="whisker_joint_x" name="whisker_move_vel_x"/>
    <velocity joint="whisker_joint_y" name="whisker_move_vel_y"/>
    <plugin joint="whisker_joint_z" plugin="mujoco.pid" instance="pid" />
  </actuator>

  <sensor>
    <jointpos joint="base2whisker_x" name="base2whisker_x"/>
    <jointpos joint="base2whisker_y" name="base2whisker_y"/>
    <jointpos joint="base2whisker_z" name="base2whisker_z"/>
    <velocimeter site="vel_sensor" name="vel_sensor"/>

    <jointpos joint="whisker_joint_x" name="whisker_joint_x"/>
    <jointpos joint="whisker_joint_y" name="whisker_joint_y"/>
    <jointpos joint="whisker_joint_z" name="whisker_joint_z"/>
    <framepos objtype="site" objname="whiskerS_last" reftype="site" refname="vel_sensor" name="tip_pos"/>
  </sensor>
```

>ðŸ“Œ In the simulation, it is actually a direct way to build unique mapping from instantaneous deflection moment to shaft tip position, since the tip position was already known by `framepos` sensor. However impossible for sensor in real world. We still need to calibrate the deflection profile first via grid-format touch by motorized stage and then, based on fitted polynomial profile, gradient descent method and pre-known length of shaft to manually extract tip data.
